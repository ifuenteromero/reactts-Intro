Typescript = Javascript + a type system

The TS Type System 
-   Help us catch errors during development
-   Uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code
-   Only active during development
-   Doesn't provide any performance optimization

SUMMARY
Writing Typescript is the same as writing Javascript with some "extra documentation".
Typescript has no effect on how our code gets executed by the browser or Node.
It is best to think of Typescript as being like a friend sitting behind you while you are coding.
